Upon first glance, the [real] Craigslist homepage layout resembles the classifieds section of the newspaper: it's tightly packed 
with text and no images. Despite the bland layout, several main functions are clear: post, search, pick a sub/category, and change 
location. In redesigning the homepage, our group decided to retain the usefulness that the categories (community, personals, housing,
etc.) provide, while making them more inviting to the user to click on through the use of images to represent each of the categories,
laid out in a grid. The text label for each category image was white with some text shadow, which gave it some contrast over the 
colorful images and made it readable. We also decided to give the site a black navigation bar with white text that had a bit of 
letter spacing, in order to keep the design clean but elegant. We decided to put the searchbar in the upper left corner, because 
we felt that while it was an essential feature of a classifieds website, we wanted to focus the user's attention on the array of 
categories and to encourage them to use those to explore the website.
